### My GitHub account is brand new
### This is the repository I'll use to store files for future projects. It's under Documents in my file explorer
### I downloaded Github Desktop, logged in, and clones the repository by selecting from the list of repositories presented in my files. I went back to github, opened the readme file in github and then edited the code. After that, I committed the changes.
